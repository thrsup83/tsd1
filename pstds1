Configuration Reversion: Revert the deployment targeting in the SCCM console and initiate the removal of the current update package.

Baseline Restoration: Re-deploy the previous stable version (Baseline) to the collection to ensure the environment returns to its known standard state.

Endpoint Alignment: If any node does not automatically align with the baseline version, perform a manual re-installation of the stable MSI to ensure 100% service consistency.

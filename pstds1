1. Implementation Plan
Contact the server owner and stakeholders before starting.

Log in to the AWS Management Console.

Navigate to the EC2 Dashboard and locate instance [Instance_Name/ID].

Identify all EBS volumes attached to the instance.

Create a manual Snapshot of the Root and Data volumes as a safety backup.

Wait for the snapshot status to be "Completed".

Access the server via RDP or AWS Systems Manager (SSM).

Open PowerShell as Administrator.

Verify the current SQL version using: (Get-Item "C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL15.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Binn\sqlservr.exe").VersionInfo.FileVersion.

Stop all SQL Server-related services to prevent file locks.

Run the installer for KB5068405.

Follow the installation wizard steps and accept the terms.

Once the installation is finished, restart the server.

Ensure all SQL services are started and set to "Automatic".

2. Test Plan
Verify that the SQL Server service (MSSQLSERVER) is "Running".

Log in to the server and open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

Execute the command: SELECT @@VERSION.

Confirm the output shows version 15.0.2155.2.

Run the PowerShell command again to confirm the file version of sqlservr.exe.

Check the Windows Event Viewer for any SQL-related errors.

Request the application owner to perform a functional test.

Confirm the application can connect and query the database successfully.

3. Backout Plan
In case of failure, attempt to uninstall KB5068405 via "Programs and Features" > "View Installed Updates".

Restart the services and verify if the issue is resolved.

If the system is unstable or the update cannot be removed:

Power off the AWS EC2 instance.

Detach the current EBS volumes.

Restore the EBS volumes from the Snapshots taken before the implementation.

Attach the restored volumes back to the instance.

Power on the instance and verify the previous version (15.0.2145.1).

Confirm service stability and notify stakeholders of the rollback.

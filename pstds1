Implementation Plan
Package Acquisition: Download the latest Google Chrome Enterprise (MSI) 64-bit binaries from the official Google vendor repository.

SCCM Application Creation: Create the application in the SCCM console, configuring silent installation parameters (e.g., msiexec /i "GoogleChromeStandaloneEnterprise64.msi" /qn /norestart /l*v "C:\Windows\Temp\Chrome_Install.log").

Content Distribution: Distribute the application content to the designated Distribution Points (DPs) and verify the "Success" status in the Content Monitoring tab.

Targeting & Collection Refresh: Update the target Device Collection with the specific servers. Perform a membership evaluation to ensure all intended nodes are correctly listed.

Deployment Scheduling: Create a "Required" deployment. Set the deadline to trigger within the approved maintenance window to ensure zero impact during business hours.

Progress Monitoring: Monitor the Deployment Status through the SCCM Monitoring node to track real-time compliance and identify any "In Progress" or "Error" states.

Test Plan
Console Verification: Review the SCCM Deployment Status dashboard to ensure the compliance rate is trending toward 100%.

Automated Validation: Execute the PowerShell script Check-ChromeVersion against the collection to programmatically confirm that the executable version matches the intended release.

Log Analysis: Randomly sample target servers and inspect the AppEnforce.log and the custom install log in C:\Windows\Temp\ to verify exit code 0 (Success).

Application Launch: Perform a manual smoke test on a subset of servers to ensure the browser launches correctly and no GPO conflicts are present.

Backout Plan
Deployment Deletion: Immediately delete or disable the current "Required" deployment in SCCM to stop any further installations.

Rollback Package: Create and deploy a "Uninstall" application targeted at the same collection to remove the problematic version.

Legacy Restoration: Re-deploy the previous stable version package to the collection if a specific version is required for business continuity.

Manual Remediation: If the automated rollback fails on specific nodes, execute the MSI uninstall string via remote PowerShell or manual intervention on affected servers.

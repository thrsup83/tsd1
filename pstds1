Implementation Plan
Pre-requisites: Download the Java JRE installer and verify the file integrity.

Snapshot: Perform a VMware Snapshot of the server (exclude virtual machine memory) to ensure a recovery point.

Service Stop: Stop all application services that depend on the Java runtime.

Installation: Execute the Java JRE installer following the wizard. Perform a clean installation by removing previous versions if required.

Environment Check: Verify and update system environment variables (JAVA_HOME and Path) if necessary.

Cleanup: Delete the installer from the temporary folder.

Test Plan
Version Validation: Open the Command Prompt and run the command java -version to confirm the update.

Service Check: Restart the application services and ensure they are in a "Running" state.

Log Review: Check application logs for any Java-related errors or exceptions.

Functional Test: Coordinate with the application team to verify if the system is fully operational.

Backout Plan
Trigger: If the application services fail to start or critical errors are identified during testing that cannot be resolved within the change window.

Manual Rollback: Attempt to uninstall the new version and reinstall the previous Java version.

Snapshot Reversal: If the manual rollback is unsuccessful, revert the virtual machine to the VMware Snapshot taken before the maintenance.

Stability Check: Power on the VM and confirm that the previous Java version and services are stable and functioning as expected.
